            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
             <li>3/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
             <li>1/2 pound (2 sticks) butter, softened</li>

            <li>8 ounces semisweet chocolate chips</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oven to 375Â°F.</li>
            <li>Whisk the flour, salt, and baking soda and salt together in a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Use an electric mixer to cream the butter and granulated and brown sugars in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time and beat until well blended, then mix in the vanilla. Add the dry ingredients to the creamed mixture and stir until just incorporated. Fold in the chocolate.</li>
            <li>Drop tablespoon-size mounds of dough about 2 inches apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake until lightly browned on the bottom, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool for about 2 minutes on the sheets before transferring the cookies to wire racks to finish cooling. Store in a covered container at room temperature for a day or 2.</li>
